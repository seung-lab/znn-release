Tutorial
========
Since python interface is more convinient to use, this tutorial only focus on usage of python interface.

File preparation
----------------

Image format
````````````
The dataset is simply a 3D ``tif`` image stacks. 

============== ================= ===========
type            format            bit depth
============== ================= ===========
raw image       .tif              8
label image     .tif              32 or RGB
============== ================= ===========

* For training, you should prepare pairs of ``tif`` files, one is raw image, another is labeled image. 
* For forward pass, only the raw image stack was needed.

Image Configuration
```````````````````
The image pairs was defined as a **Sample**. The image pair of a sample was defined in a dataset configuration file. This `example <https://github.com/seung-lab/znn-release/blob/master/dataset/ISBI2012/dataset.spec>`_ illustrates the meaning of each parameter in the configuration file.

Network architecture configuration
``````````````````````````````````
Please refer to the `examples <https://github.com/seung-lab/znn-release/tree/master/networks>`_.

Parameter Configuration
```````````````````````
The training/forward parameters could be set using a configuration file. This `example <https://github.com/seung-lab/znn-release/blob/master/python/config.cfg>`_ illustrated the parameters and the meaning of each parameter.

Training
--------

Run a Training
``````````````
After setting up the configuration file, you can run a training: 
::
    python train.py -c path/of/config.cfg 

Resume a training
`````````````````
Since the network was periodically saved, we can resume training whenever we want to. In default, ZNN will automatically resume the latest training net (``net_current.h5``) in a folder, which was specified by the ``train_net`` parameter in the configuration file. 

To resume a specific network, we can use the seeding function:
::
    python train.py -c path/of/config.cfg -s path/of/seed.h5

Transfer learning
`````````````````
Sometimes, we would like to utilize a trained network. If the network architectures of trained and initialized network are the same, we call it ``Loading``. Otherwise, we call is ``Seeding``, in which case the trained net is used as a seed to initialized part of the new network. Our implementation merges ``Loading`` and ``Seeding``, and use ``-s`` or ``--seed``. 
::
    python train.py -c path/of/config.cfg -s path/of/seed.h5

Forward pass
------------
run the following command:
::
    python forward.py -c path/of/config.cfg
